AI Video Generation Pipeline –

I built an end-to-end automated pipeline that generates a YouTube-ready video from a single topic input. The system takes a topic, generates a script using an LLM (Groq), converts the script into voice narration using Edge-TTS, fetches relevant stock videos from the Pexels API, and automatically edits them together using MoviePy to produce a final video.

The entire pipeline runs with one command and requires no manual editing, fulfilling the requirement of full automation using free tools.

Tools Used

Python

Groq API (script generation)

Edge-TTS (voiceover)

Pexels API (video footage)

MoviePy + FFmpeg (video editing)

Biggest Challenge
Managing API limits and model deprecations while keeping the pipeline fully free. I solved this by switching to Groq’s free LLM and ensuring all steps run locally.

Improvements
Future improvements would include auto-thumbnail generation, subtitle generation, and direct YouTube upload integration.
